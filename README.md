## TL;DR

Search for product resources from a search bar with:

[product] [resource] [specifier] ↵

Bookmarks x Spotlight Search.

[Demo here](https://product-telescope.vercel.app/)

## The Problem

Products have a million and one assets to keep track of. At Nylas, this is no exception. Every team needs to refer to things such as:

- roadmaps
- bug reporting portals
- slack channels
- product requirement docs
- UI mockups
- Jira projects
- correct point-of-contacts
- competitive analysis
- etc.

As such, myself and the majority of my colleagues have 100+ tabs open just to not lose track of things. 

## The Solution

A marriage between bookmarks and Apple's Spotlight Search. Populated with the most commonly used resources for each product, allowing teams to close their 50+ tabs without worry of losing the link.

Type in the product (or select fromt he auto-complete), then the resource, then the specifier.

Example:

"scheduler roadmap q3" ↵

## The Outcome

Myself and a dozen other colleagues of mine at Nylas started using this daily, allowing us to close A LOT of tabs we previously didn't dare touch.

Peace of mind.
